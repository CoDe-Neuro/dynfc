from numpy import cos

def phDiff(a, b):
    """Cosine of phase difference.

    This function estimates the phase difference of the two entries and its cosine.

    $$PL = \cos{(a - b)}$$

    Args:
        a (double): Phase 1 in $\pi$ rad.
        b (double): Phase 2 in $\pi$ rad.

    Returns:
        double: Cosine of phase difference.

    Example:
            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> a = np.pi
            >>> b = - np.pi
            >>> print(phDiff(a,b))
            1.0
